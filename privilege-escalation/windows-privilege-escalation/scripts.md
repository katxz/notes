# Scripts

Find services running as localsystem

* PowerUp.ps1 does check on modifiable service file and shows StartName \(see 10.2.2.31 MANAGER\) which does two things, check StartName and see if current user can modify the files of that service. I should learn how to do this manually, the existing scripts are not very helpful.

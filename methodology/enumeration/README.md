# Enumeration

When scanning across the network, compare open ports. Can use ones that have similar setup to get hints about how services are running. \(E.g. check what sqlserver 2017 looks like via RDP while trying to blind exploit it on another machine\). Another example is port 2233, have no idea what it is until we can see it for ourselves after a box is rooted and have it running.
